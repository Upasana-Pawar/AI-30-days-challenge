# Day 4 â€” Pandas Practice

**What I Did**
- Cleaned `movies_data.csv` (coerced numeric columns, handled missing titles).
- Created new features: `decade` and `first_genre`.
- Computed summaries: average rating per decade, top genres.
- Saved cleaned CSV and generated visualizations.

**What I Learnt**
- Practical usage of `pandas` for cleaning and grouping.
- Handling mixed-format numeric fields (commas, currency).
- Creating features for trend analysis (decade).

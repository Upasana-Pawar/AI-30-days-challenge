# Day 18 â€” Ensemble Learning (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)

## Overview
Train and compare bagging, boosting, and stacking models on the sklearn `breast_cancer` dataset. The script trains:
- RandomForest (bagging-like)
- AdaBoost (boosting)
- GradientBoosting (boosting)
- Stacking (RF + GB + LR -> meta LR)

It saves models, plots, and a metrics summary.

# Day 3 — Visualizations (Matplotlib + Seaborn)

**Project:** Day 3 of my 30-day AI roadmap — exploratory visualizations for a movies dataset.

---

## What I Did
- Created a Python script (`Matplotlib.py`) that loads a movies dataset (`movies_data.csv`).
- Set up and used a virtual environment in VS Code.
- Installed and used Python libraries: **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**.
- Wrote code to auto-detect dataset columns (Rating, Genre, Year, etc.).
- Generated and saved multiple visualizations into the `figures/` folder:
  - Histogram of Ratings  
  - Top 10 Genres bar chart  
  - Rating by Genre (boxplot)  
  - Average Rating by Year (line plot)  
  - Movies per Year (bar plot)  
  - Correlation Heatmap of numeric columns

## What I Learnt
- How to use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create visualizations.  
- How to explore datasets with **pandas** (checking shapes, columns, missing values).  
- The importance of cleaning/coercing numeric data before plotting.  
- How to handle categorical columns with multiple values (e.g., genres split by `|` or `,`).  
- How to organize and save plots automatically into a folder for easy reference.  
- Basics of using VS Code with virtual environments and git integration.
